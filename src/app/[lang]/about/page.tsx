              Hi, I'm Markus Stuppnig â€” a freelance IT consultant based in
              Vienna, Austria.
              <br />I have a deep love for technology. There's something magical
              about taking something simple and giving it the ability to learn,
              adapt, and make decisions on its own. This fascination led me to
              specialize in{" "}
